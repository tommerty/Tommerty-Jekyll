New blog, new life. Don't expect this blog to follow any structure or meaning. I'm going to write about what I feel about writting about, may be it be a personal thing, a coding/development related thing, or just sonething I want to rant about. This is something new, and something that's soley for me. I'm not going to be promoting this blog, I'm not going to be sharing it with anyone. This is just for me. If you're reading this, you're either a friend of mine, or you're a stalker. Either way, welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay.

I follow the "rubber ducky" philosophy quite a lot, and I plan on taking that to this. I can start a conversation here, and by the last paragraph do a complete u-turn on the matter. Also expect spelling mistakes and other problematic things. I'm writting this in Visual Studio Code, and for obvious reasons it doesn't provide a spellcheck. I'm also not going to be proof reading this, so if you see a spelling mistake, or a grammatical error, please feel free to let me know. I'm not going to be offended, I'm going to be thankful.

I'm going to be using this blog as a way to express myself, and to get things off my chest. If I feel like I want to talk about something, so be it. I will try to mainly use it as a way to document certain things so I can find later, too. I often have problems remembering things like "how do I ssh into my docker container and ensure I can run WP-CLI commands", so expect a post on that soon ðŸ˜….

But yeah, welcome to the blog or whatever you want to call it.
