Where do I even begin with this? So at one stage of my life, I "aspired" to be a streamer. It was lockdown, I was bored, get over it. Anyway, instead of running out and buying expensive lighting equipment, I decided to dedicate my money on a Sony A5100, Elgato CamLink, and extensive audio gear such as a podcasting mic and a GoXLR Mini to power it. This obviously left little room for lighting gear so I decided to cheap out and buy some cheap LED rin lights from Amazon. I bought two of these, and they worked great. They were bright, they were cheap, and they were easy to use. I was happy.

Skip forward 3 years, one of these lights crapped the bed. Completely gone. No worries however, I had a second. And with me mainly just using the light for Zoom calls in work and other needs, it actually did the job when I needed better lighting.


I was using the laptop, all was fine. I went to turn it off, and I noticed it started doing something odd. It had "powered off" at least out of Windows, but it kept a black screen and the LED light for the power button was still on. I thought not much of it, thought Windows was just being Windows, and held the button down to force it to power off. This was the last time I'd hear the stupidy loud fans spin.

I decided I wanted to download some games so I booted the laptop, but nothing happened. Well, the LED on the power button lit up, but nothing else. No fans, no screen, nothing. I tried everything. I tried removing the battery, holding the power button down for 30 seconds, removing the RAM, removing the SSD, removing the CMOS battery, everything. Nothing worked. I was left with a dead laptop.

I brought it to a local repair shop on Thursday (today is now Monday) and still no definate answer. I just called them to give them vital information however:
I plugged the ring light I bought from Amazon into my USB hub for a meeting, and poof. The smell, the flickering, the power went out on the hub. I called the store to let them know that this happened, and I also kept this same light plugged into the laptop at all times, likely frying the motherboard... They're investigating it now, but I'm not hopeful.

I will update this further as the week progresses.
