### My story

I've always had a passion about computers and technology. At the age of 6 I "built" my first website which basically embedded my favourite games from the internet into one page so I didn't have to have a billion tabs open to play all my favourite games.
Come the age of 18 I decided to get back into computers and as a musician at the time I wanted a way to build a website to host and sell music. I then got *very* ambitious and attempted to build something akin to BandCamp and failed terribly due to the fact that I was trying to do it all on WordPress and without a development bone in my body, I failed to achieve this using off the shelf plugins.

As a gamer, I got back into coding when I fell in love with Grand Theft Auto RolePlay servers, and decided to build my own. I then realised how difficult this was going to be. On my way, I made a friend who helped with the code. I mainly adjusted existing settings, while my friend Trent was building new things. As always however, it fell apart due to lack of time and motivation.

As someone who streamed a lot during this time, I decided to move my stream from Twitch over to YouTube, but as someone who built a lot of things to make my stream interactive, I missed this element on YouTube. I spoke with Trent on the matter and within a week we had built the initial release of [YouTube Channel Rewards](https://ytcr.gezel.io). This was a huge success and we had a lot of fun building it. We then decided to build and host multiple more projects that were initiated by the success of YTCR, and [Mystlink](https://mystl.ink) and [GezelBot](https://gezelbot.com) were born.

Along the through this entire journey, I've had a lot of personal things happen to bring me up and down. The passing of family members, the stress of a working in previous jobs I hated that gave little freedom, and personal relationship struggles. I'm happy to be writing this about me page now, as I'm in a much better place in life, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me.
